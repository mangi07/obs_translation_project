obs_translation_project
=======================

Android app to translate OBS

The folder "TestJGitAndHTML5" contains the files necessary to set up the project in Eclipse.
The user interface has been set up to load independent of the internet,
but now I need to make it functional - implement functions that fire when the user interacts.
